Better static assert messages for `std.algorithm.sorting.sort`

Up until now `sort` used a template constraint to check if the passed Range
could be used. If it were not, it was very tedious to figure out why.

As the template constraint is not used to overload the symbol template
function, the constrains are move into static asserts with expressive error
messages.
