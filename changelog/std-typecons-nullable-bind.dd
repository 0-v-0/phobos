`bind` was added to std.typecons.

$(REF bind, std, typecons) is an operation for $(D Nullable) values that "unpacks" the $(D Nullable), performs some
operation (that is passed as a template parameter), then packs the result into another $(D Nullable) if necessary.
When the initial $(D Nullable) is $(D null), the resulting $(D Nullable) is also $(D null) and the function is not
called.

Nullable!int square(Nullable!int n)
{
    return n.bind!(i => i * i);
}
